    "\n",
    "Mizore supports Quantum Subspace Diagonalization (QSD), as in the paper \"[A non-orthogonal variational quantum eigensolver](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab867b)\".\n",

A more practical subspace is spanned by the states generated in the *Krylov* way. Suppose we have a state $\\ket{\\psi}$ near the ground state, such as the Hartree-Fock state. The Krylov subspace is like $\\operatorname{span}(\\{e^{iHn\\Delta t}\\ket{\\psi}|n=0,1,\\cdots\\})$. In Mizore, a QSD algorithm with Krylov subspace can be easily carried out as follows."

    "## Sparse circuit \n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The developers of Mizore believe that in near-term, practical chemical calculation by quantum computer will not be realized by having the quantum computer produce exactly the ground state. Rather, the quantum computer should produce the basis of a subspace that contains the ground state. The dimension of the subspace should be a intermediate number so that the states in the basis can be prepared by near-term devices and in the meantime give speed-up with respect to the classical methods like exact diagonalization (ED). \n",
    "\n",
    "We find that in previous efforts, people use either states that can be easily produced by very many (such as the computational basis which can be produced classically)(such as in ED), or state that is very difficult to produce (such as the true ground state)(such as in VQE). We conjecture that we can use *intermediate* number of partly entangled circuits, which is of *intermediate* difficulty to produce, to span the subspace that covers the ground state. The qubits in those circuits can be divided into separable sets. We call the circuits with many separable sets *sparse circuits*.\n",
    "\n",
    "(See also the README file in the root path)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the importance of sparse circuit mentioned above, Mizore provides intrinsic support for sparse circuit in `BlockCircuit` and `Blocks._sparse_utilities` as follows."
