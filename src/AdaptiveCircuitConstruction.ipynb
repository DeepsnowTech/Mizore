    "# Adaptive Circuit Constrction\n",
    "\n",
    "Mizore provides a framework for adaptive VQE like what is described in [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2020, 16, 2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b01084) and [Nat Commun 10, 3007 (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10988-2), where the structure of the parameterized quantum circuits is also optimized, differing from traditional VQE which uses a fixed parameterized circuit and only varies the parameter. While providing better performance of convergence, adaptive method can also achieve certain objective with fewer quantum gates. We believe that adaptive circuit construction is a key method for near-term quantum applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In adaptive circuit construction algorithms, ansatz circuits are adaptively constructed by selecting and adding blocks from a predefined pool $\\mathcal{E}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, in each iteration, we do the following steps\n",
    "- Go over the blocks in $\\mathcal{E}$;\n",
    "- Calculate a score of every block based on certain criterion;\n",
    "- Add the entangler with highest score to the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe circuit construction is important for *near-term* quantum computing because their adaptiveness can help them place the entangling gates in a more efficient way than the methods use fixed circuits. The two-qubit gate advantage of including adaptiveness has been shown in some works.\n",
    "\n",
    "To design a adaptive circuit construction algorithm, one needs to define\n",
    "- The blocks pool $\\mathcal{E}$;\n",
    "- The criterion for scoring the blocks;\n",
    "- Where to add the new block.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Mizore, we provide a general framework `CircuitConstrutor` for design such a framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "Including\n",
    "- Handy block pool tools (See [BlockPools](BlockPools.ipynb) for details);\n",
    "- Modules for efficiently and parallelly calculate usually used scores;\n",
    "- Extendable framework for define the way blocks are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, we show how to start a simple circuit construction, in which\n",
    "- New blocks are added to the end of the circuit;\n",
    "- The blocks score is based on the energy they can decrease by adding it to the end of the circuit;\n",
    "- Energy descent gradient is calculated first and the blocks with high gradient will be selected to do a parameter optimization;\n",
    "- The energy descent presented in the parameter optimization is defined to be the score of a block.\n",
    "\n",
    "This construction can be easily carried out with the class `GreedyConstructor`. Here we start from construct the problem Hamiltonian and block pool."
